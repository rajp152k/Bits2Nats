Hey there, This is Raj.   


I plan on being proficient in the domain of Machine Learning and know that writing is a satisfying and tested path to competence. This is quite an important part of my intellectual pursuits and as with anything, I'd like to be good at it. I do realize that there'll always be quite a long way to go. This is all the more reason to document the path that I take for fellow travellers. I won't be infusing a lot of personal style into the content that I post here (well, not as much as I'm naturally inclined to).


If you'd like to know more about me and my epistemological pursuits as a whole, have a look at my [root site](https://rajpatil.dev)
